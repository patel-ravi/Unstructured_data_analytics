# Unstructured_data_analytics

basic text analysis, Entity Recognition and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI):

This repository contains codes written by me as academic assignment (HW1) for the course 94-775 Unstructured Data Analytics for Policy (Spring 2022) at CMU.

In the first part of the file 'HW1 - rjpatel.ipynb', the code performs basic text analysis such as, extracting file names from a given directory, calculating string length for all files in the directory, splitting content into multiple files, finding word frequencies, sorting and ranking based on various criteria,producing exploratory visualizations to understand the data, calculating various percentages and proportions, etc.

In the second part of the file 'HW1 - rjpatel.ipynb', the code performs Entity Recognition and computes Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for a set of words.
